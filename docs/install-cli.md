# Brook

## Install via curl

Let's take the v20210214 version downloaded on linux amd64 as an example

```
$ curl -L https://github.com/txthinking/brook/releases/download/v20210214/brook_linux_amd64 -o /usr/bin/brook
$ chmod +x /usr/bin/brook
```

> The first command is to use the curl command to download the brook_linux_amd64 command file of the Linux 64-bit v20210214 version, and rename it and save it to the /usr/bin/brook path.<br/>
> The second command is to use the chmod command to give executable permissions to the /usr/bin/brook file.
